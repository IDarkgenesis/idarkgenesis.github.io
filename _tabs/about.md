I’m a Computer Science Engineer with experience in **back-end development** and **video game programming**, including **engine** and **graphics development**. 

My expertise spans multiple technologies, and I thrive on taking on new challenges that push my skills further. I’m always eager to learn new programming languages and explore emerging tech to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.

With over 3 years of experience in back-end engineering, I’ve also had the opportunity to develop a video game using a custom C++ and OpenGL [engine](https://github.com/TheCenturiaGames/Sobrassada_Engine). This project involved collaborating with a cross-functional team of 20 people, and we delivered a fully functional [game](https://thecenturiagames.github.io/CenturiaGames/index.html) within a year.

Outside of coding, I’m a big fan of tabletop games—they’re a great way to stretch my strategic thinking—and I’m also into archery. Both are awesome ways to unwind, and they help me stay sharp and focused, which definitely comes in handy in my work.
