I’m a Computer Science Engineer with experience in **back-end development** and **video game programming**, including **engine** and **graphics development**. 

My expertise spans multiple technologies, and I thrive on taking on new challenges that push my skills further. I’m always eager to learn new programming languages and explore emerging tech to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.

With over 3 years of experience in back-end engineering, I’ve also had the opportunity to develop a video game using a custom C++ and OpenGL engine. This project involved collaborating with a cross-functional team of 20 people, and we delivered a fully functional game within a year.
